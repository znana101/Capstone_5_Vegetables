## Discussion
1. The project demonstrates high accuracy in detecting and classifying various vegetables using a YOLO-based object detection model, showcasing its potential for real-world agricultural applications.
2. Data augmentation techniques like random flipping and rotation improved the model's robustness by enabling it to handle diverse visual scenarios effectively.
3. The evaluation metrics, including mAP (mean Average Precision), highlighted the model's strong performance in precise vegetable identification, ensuring reliability in practical deployments.

Conclusion: The model overall performed well as all classes obtained a mAP of higher than 0.75.
